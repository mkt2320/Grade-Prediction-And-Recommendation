Student Grade Prediction and Recommendation System

Overview
This research project addresses the challenge of student dropout rates in higher education by developing a system for predicting grades and offering recommendations. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset, the study aims to construct a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting grades and identifying influential factors.
